## Simple Automated Script
This repository includes a simple automated script which injects the `xmrig` miner into Debian-based systems as a system service and persists along reboots.

**Simple to use:**
- Kindly change the URL of `xmrig` and `config.json` to your file location address.
- **Please don't forget to add the URL of `xmrig` and the config.**
- You can also set your own FTP server and place files in it.

## Objective
This project is designed to provide valuable insights and support for individuals interested in cryptocurrency mining. We focus on educational aspects and best practices rather than direct mining operations.
